## Highlights from Thunderstorm Showcase

We had the incredible opportunity to participate in the annual I&E department Startup Showcase at Duke University. It was a fantastic chance to learn about the innovative work happening within the Duke community and to form valuable relationships with others utilizing similar resources.
The following day, we were privileged to pitch our company and product to the I&E board of advisors. This experience was invaluable as it provided an opportunity to gain critical feedback from individuals outside our industry. The questions and suggestions we received were insightful and have already begun to shape our strategic direction.

## Engaging Discussions and Collaborations

Throughout the conference, TOWSTER Corporation's team engaged in meaningful discussions with potential partners and numerous government representatives. The enthusiastic reception of their innovations paved the way for promising partnerships and numerous potential funding avenues.

## Looking Ahead

Stay tuned for more updates from TOWSTER Corporation as they continue to push the boundaries of innovation and shape the future of defense technology.
